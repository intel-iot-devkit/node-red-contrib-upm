## node-red-node-upm

<a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> nodes to talk to <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/sensors" target="_blank">sensors & actuators</a> supported by the <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm" target="_blank">UPM</a> library

### Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install, usually
this is ~/.node-red .

        npm install node-red-contrib-upm

### Usage

Only tested on the Intel Edison so far, but it should work on other platforms supported by <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa" target="_blank">MRAA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm" target="_blank">UPM</a>.

Ensure you have the latest firmware running, and have Node-RED installed.

See the [Intel Downloads](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/home) for
hardware / downloads for your particular board.

If you do need to install Node-RED, you can do this as follows from the home directory of the root user

        npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
        mkdir .node-red
        cd .node-red
        npm install node-red-contrib-upm

Then run

    node-red
